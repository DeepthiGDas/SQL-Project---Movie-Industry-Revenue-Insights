# SQL Project: Comprehensive Revenue Analysis
## Project Description
This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for analyzing a movie dataset to uncover revenue insights. The project leverages advanced SQL techniques to process and analyze over 1 million records, aiming to extract valuable business intelligence.
### Key SQL Techniques Utilized
- SQL Basics: Employed fundamental SQL operations such as SELECT, WHERE, BETWEEN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to query and sort data.
- Joins: Applied various join types including LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, FULL, and CROSS to combine and analyze data across multiple tables.
- Subqueries and CTEs: Used subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for nested queries and better readability.
- Views and Temporary Tables: Created views and temporary tables to simplify complex queries and improve query performance.
- ETL Processes: Implemented Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to clean and prepare data for analysis.
- Window Functions: Utilized window functions like OVER, ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK for advanced data analysis and ranking.
### Advanced SQL Features
- User Defined Functions and Stored Procedures: Developed functions and procedures to automate repetitive tasks and optimize query performance.
- Data Warehousing Concepts: Applied principles of Data Warehousing, OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) for effective data management and analysis.
- Performance Optimization: Focused on optimizing query performance through indexing and efficient query design.
### Project Components
- SQL Scripts: Includes screenshots of SQL queries used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
## Conclusion
This project helped me learn and harness the power of SQL and MySQL in managing and analyzing extensive datasets. By utilizing advanced SQL techniques, such as complex joins, window functions, and ETL processes, I efficiently handled over 1 million records to perform detailed revenue analysis. The use of SQL enabled precise data extraction, transformation, and reporting, resulting in actionable insights that significantly supported data-driven decision-making. This project highlights SQLâ€™s critical role in data analysis and its effectiveness in deriving meaningful insights from large-scale data.
